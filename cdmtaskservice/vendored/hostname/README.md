# Vendored `python-hostname` package

This is vendored code from the [python-hostname](https://github.com/jpgoldberg/python-hostname)
repo, commit 461d80edbad4d58f71968fbdb7884df28d78c7c2, version 0.0.5.

There is no pypi release for this package, so vendoring seems like the easiest way to include it
in the codebase. As such, imports have been modified to work in the vendored namespace.

If the package is ever released on PyPi, this vendoring should be obliterated.

There is currently no licensing information for the package.
